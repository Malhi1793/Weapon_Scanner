# Weapon Scanner
The project uses the concept of RCNN to detect and locate weapons in XRay scans of baggage. This particular project detects guns and knives, however, the neural network can be trained on any dataset and can detect any number and any type of items from an image or a video. 

## What is R-CNN?
A conventional CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is a deep learninng model that can classify images on the basis of certain features that it detects during the training phase. 
An RCNN (Regional Neural Network) can be thought of as an improvement over the CNN as it can not only detect the presence of an object in the image, it can also give and mark it's location on the image and can detect multiple objects in a single image.

## The Project
For this project we have used a pre trained model, as it takes less time to train and gives us a really good accuracy on our dataset.

I could not upload the files for the project due to the size of the dataset in the project. However, I have uploaded the project report for the same which contains the working screenshots and code snippets of the project.
